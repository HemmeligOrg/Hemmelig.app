## How it works


You enter [https://hemmelig.app](https://hemmelig.app), write your sensitive information, expire time, optional password, and click create a secret link. You share the secret link. The receiver of the link opens it, writes the optional password, and retrieves the sensitive information.
When a secret link is created, it gets its unique encryption key that is not saved to the database and only will be part of the URL. This is how the encryption works: `encrypt(DATA, YOUR_UNIQUE_ENCRYPTION_KEY)`. The encryption of the text and files is done in the client; this means the server will get the encrypted information, and nothing in clear text.

Hemmelig.app is running on Linode, and is not being sponsored by anyone. If you want to support Hemmelig, and use Linode. Here is a referral link that we get free credit if you use. By using this link you will get $100 of credit as well: [https://www.linode.com/lp/refer/?r=a47390eeafc5a46b8e5407a5d2bf28368d474993](https://www.linode.com/lp/refer/?r=a47390eeafc5a46b8e5407a5d2bf28368d474993)

## Docker image

Hemmelig strongly advice you to ue the tagged docker images as the main branch will have breaking changes now and then. For Hemmelig versions supporting Redis, use <= v4.4.0.

Supported docker platforms: `amd/64`, `arm/64`. 

- hemmeligapp/hemmelig:latest (Is created on each version release)
- hemmeligapp/hemmelig:v5.7.2 see [tags](https://github.com/HemmeligOrg/Hemmelig.app/tags) for all version
- hemmeligapp/hemmelig:weekly (pushed every week on Friday)
- hemmeligapp/hemmelig:daily

## Self-hosting

If you have to follow some sort of compliance, and have to self-host, [https://hemmelig.app](https://hemmelig.app) is available as a docker image. The following is the bare minimum to run the docker image.

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --name=hemmelig \
   -v ./data/hemmelig/:/var/tmp/hemmelig/upload/files \ # For the file uploads
   -v ./database/:/home/node/hemmelig/database/ \       # For the sqlite database
   hemmeligapp/hemmelig:v5.0.0
```

Alternatively you can use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```bash
# fetch docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HemmeligOrg/Hemmelig.app/main/docker-compose.yml

# start hemmelig 
docker-compose up -d

# stop containers
docker-compose down
```

Have a look at the Dockerfile for a full example of how to run this application.

## CLI

Hemmelig can be used as a CLI to create secrets on the fly!

```bash
# Pipe data to hemmelig
cat mysecretfile | npx hemmelig

# For the documentaiton
npx hemmelig --help
```

## Supported languages

Have a look at the `public/locales/` folder.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install

# Start the frontend/backend
npm run dev
# http://0.0.0.0:3001

```

## Database
Hemmelig has changed from using Redis as an backend to sqlite. Here we are using Prisma, and the sqlite file is available here:
`/database/hemmelig.db`. Have a look at the docker-compose file for how to handle the database.

## Admin, roles and settings
Admins have access to adjust certain settings in Hemmelig. If you go to the account -> instance settings, you can see all the settings.

We also have different roles.
- Admin
- Creator
- User

The difference here is that if you i.e. set Hemmelig to be in read only mode, only `admin` and `creator` is allowed to create secrets, but non signed in users, and users with the role `user` can only view them.

Admins are also allowed to create new users in the settings. This is great if you want to limit who your users are by the `disable user account creation` setting.

## Common errors
If this errors occur on the first run of your hemmelig instance, this means there are some issues with the ownership of the files/directory for the database.

```bash
Datasource "db": SQLite database "hemmelig.db" at "file:../database/hemmelig.db"

Error: Migration engine error:
SQLite database error
unable to open database file: ../database/hemmelig.db
```

If you have any issues with uploading files for your instance, you will need the following as well:

Here is an example of how you would solve that:
```bash
sudo chown -R username.group /home/username/data/
sudo chown -R username.group /home/username/database/
```
