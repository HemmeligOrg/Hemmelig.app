<h1 align="center">Encrypted secret sharing for everyone!</h1>

<div align="center">
  Hemmelig is a encrypted sharing platform that enables secure transmission of sensitive information. All encryption occurs client-side using TweetNaCl, ensuring your data remains encrypted before it reaches our servers. The platform supports both personal and organizational use cases, with features like IP restrictions, expiration controls, and optional password protection. Whether you're sharing credentials, sensitive messages, or confidential files, Hemmelig strives to ensure your data remains private and secure.

## SaaS

Hemmelig is available at [https://hemmelig.app](https://hemmelig.app)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb237fdb-d811-4809-9d01-e0bb6e2b50be


## How it works

1. Visit [https://hemmelig.app](https://hemmelig.app) and enter your sensitive information
2. Configure your secret:
   - Set expiration time
   - Add optional password
   - Set view limits or IP restrictions
3. Click "Create secret link" to generate a secure URL
4. Share the generated link with your recipient

The security model works by:

- Generating a unique encryption key for each secret
- Performing all encryption in your browser before sending to the server
- Including the decryption key only in the URL fragment (never stored on server)
- Server only stores the encrypted data, never the plain text or keys

Example encryption flow:

```javascript
encryptedData = encrypt(yourSecretData, uniqueEncryptionKey)
// Only encryptedData is sent to server
// uniqueEncryptionKey is only shared via URL
```

## Docker image

Hemmelig strongly advises you to use the tagged docker images as the main branch will have breaking changes now and then. For Hemmelig versions supporting Redis, use <= v4.4.0.

Supported docker platforms: `amd/64`, `arm/64`.

- hemmeligapp/hemmelig:latest (Is created on each version release)
- hemmeligapp/hemmelig:v5 (Is created on each version release for the major version)
- hemmeligapp/hemmelig:v5.19 (Is created on each version release for the major and minor version)
- hemmeligapp/hemmelig:v5.19.28 see [tags](https://github.com/HemmeligOrg/Hemmelig.app/tags) for all version
- hemmeligapp/hemmelig:weekly (pushed every week on Friday)
- hemmeligapp/hemmelig:daily

## Self-hosting

If you have to follow some sort of compliance, and have to self-host, [https://hemmelig.app](https://hemmelig.app) is available as a docker image. The following is the bare minimum to run the docker image.

```bash
mkdir -p data/hemmelig database
chown 1000:1000 data/hemmelig database

docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --name=hemmelig \
   -v ./data/hemmelig/:/var/tmp/hemmelig/upload/files \ # For the file uploads
   -v ./database/:/home/node/hemmelig/database/ \       # For the sqlite database
   hemmeligapp/hemmelig:v5.19.4
```

Alternatively you can use [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

**NEW**: Sign in with Github and edit the docker-compose.yml here https://www.dockerfile.app/docker-compose/cm2qfl57s00061059n94ruje5

```bash
# fetch docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HemmeligOrg/Hemmelig.app/main/docker-compose.yml

# create volumes directories
mkdir -p data/hemmelig database

# set permissions (Node user has UID 1000 within the container)
chown 1000:1000 data/hemmelig database

# start hemmelig 
docker compose up -d

# stop containers
docker compose down
```

Have a look at the Dockerfile for a full example of how to run this application.

## CLI

Hemmelig can be used as a CLI to create secrets on the fly!

```bash
# Pipe data to hemmelig
cat mysecretfile | npx hemmelig

# For the documentaiton
npx hemmelig --help
```

## Supported languages

Have a look at the `public/locales/` folder.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install

# Start the frontend/backend
npm run dev
# http://0.0.0.0:3001

```

## Database

Hemmelig moved from using Redis as a backend to sqlite. Here we are using Prisma, and the sqlite file is available here:
`/database/hemmelig.db`. Have a look at the docker-compose.yml file for how to handle the database.

## Admin, roles and settings

Admins have access to adjust certain settings in Hemmelig. If you go to the account -> instance settings, you can see all the settings.

We also have different roles.

- Admin
- Creator
- User

The difference here is that if you i.e. set Hemmelig to be in read only mode, only `admin` and `creator` is allowed to create secrets, but non signed in users, and users with the role `user` can only view them.

Admins are also allowed to create new users in the settings. This is great if you want to limit who your users are by the `disable user account creation` setting.

## Common errors

If this error occurs on the first run of your Hemmelig instance, this means there are some issues with the ownership of the files/directory for the database.

```bash
Datasource "db": SQLite database "hemmelig.db" at "file:../database/hemmelig.db"

Error: Migration engine error:
SQLite database error
unable to open database file: ../database/hemmelig.db
```

If you have any issues with uploading files to your instance, you will need the following as well:

Here is an example of how you would solve that:

```bash
sudo chown -R username.group /home/username/data/
sudo chown -R username.group /home/username/database/
```
